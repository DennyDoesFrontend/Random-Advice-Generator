## My process

I built out the layout with HTML and SCSS.
I went to the AdviceSlip website and read the documentation on how to use the API
After reading through the docs, I proceeded to work on the JavaScript part of the project and got it up and running.

### Built with

- HTML 5
-CSS
-Vanilla JS


### Continued development

I found APIs very interesting and cool to use. I intend to create more projects and explore different APIs and how they can make web apps more interesting.
